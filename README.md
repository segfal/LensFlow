## LensFlow

### Who This Tool Is For
Photographers/Videographers. When they come back from a long trip or a multi-day/week/month/etc. long shoot, they have hundreds of thousands of unroganized photos. Usually, they tend to separate all the files manually into their respective folders by date for archival and ease of access purposes. When a photographer wants to go back and edit their photos from a certain date this makes it easy to do. However, LensFlow takes all the guesswork and checking out of this process!

### How It Works
Our software will automatically detect your removable SD or USB drive, and sort the images in it into a directory of your choice. You have the option of selecting your SD (or any directory with unsorted images) or letting LensFlow do it for you.

### Future Steps
Give more options, such as filtering out certain file types, (.ARWs vs .JPEGs vs .TIFs etc.). Prettier UI.
