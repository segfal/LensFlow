## Who This Tool Is For
Designed for photographers and videographers, LensFlow is the solution to a common post-shoot dilemma: organizing hundreds of thousands of unsorted photos. Gone are the days of manually sorting images into folders by date. LensFlow automates this process, making it effortless to archive and access your photos for editing.

## What It Does
LensFlow simplifies photo management by automatically sorting your images by date into directories of your choice.

LensFlow was developed using Python in Visual Studio Code, with the tkinter GUI library and Pillow for metadata reading.

We're expanding LensFlow's features to include file type filtering, support for proprietary file architectures from camera manufacturers, and to modernize the UI. Future updates will also introduce "Remember Me" settings for directory preferences.
